# the parser will interpret a hash at the beginning of line as a comment
# the opening clause specifies which type of video of is encapsulated in this object
# allowed field names will vary by type, but match up to object data members
# for fields where multiple inputs make sense [like actors], the parser will add vector entries as necessary
# for fields where multiples don't make sense, the parser should gracefully handle errors in the input file
# one way to deal with this is to have the second input overwrite the first
# if a field is not in this file, it will be blank in the object
# tabs are there for human readability, the parser will ignore them
